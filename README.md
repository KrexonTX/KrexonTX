# Hey there! 👋

I'm Tomi Taskov — a friendly, slightly goofy coder from near Sofia who loves turning ideas into handy tools and scripts. 🛠️

If you're curious, I've worked on projects like a FiveM Anticheat, a YouTube downloader and sorter script, and a nifty Windows utility program. Mostly, I write in Python, Lua, and mix in a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep things interesting.

## What I’m working on

Right now, I’m piecing together more QOL (Quality of Life) scripting projects and diving into new techniques while having fun tuning cars and gaming on the side. 🎮🚗

## Tech I speak fluently

- Python
- Lua
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript (just enough to be dangerous)
